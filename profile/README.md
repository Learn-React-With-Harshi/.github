## Hello World, Welcome to my learning space 👋

I will be documenting my react learning journey in this series. I am learning React through [Namaste React Live Course]() conducted by Akshay Saini. 



About me :

👩‍💻 I'm Harshitha and I worked as a front-end developer in Bangalore (India) for 3 years before moving to Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

Currently, I am stay-at-home-mom (on a career break for 3 years now) taking care of my toddler and slowly rebooting myself to get back to work.


After moving to NL, my entire life changed. I had to quit my job, unforgettable covid pandemic hit the world, pregnancy, childbirth, postpartum blues, handling cranky toddler,.... Even if I wished to get back to work, I was not able to bounce back. Finally, after a long struggle, I am ready to reboot my  career 2.0. 


I am revising all the frond-end core skills like javascript, css and html. There are lot of new features to catch up that were released in the meantime.
