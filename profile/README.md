## Welcome to my learning space ðŸ‘‹

I will be documenting my react learning journey in this series. I am learning React through [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini and enjoying every session. 

### Where to start ?
If you are new to this learning space and wondering where to start, have a look at [Table of Contents](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/table-of-contents) for getting a better idea.

### About me :pray: :

I'm Harshitha and I worked as a front-end developer :woman_technologist: in Bangalore (India) for 3 years before moving to Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

Currently, I am stay-at-home-mom :breast_feeding: (on a career break for 3 years now), taking care of my toddler :family_man_woman_girl: and slowly rebooting myself to bounce back to work.

In my career reboot 2.0 journey, I am revising all the frond-end core skills like javascript, css and html and other libraries. There are lot of new features to catch up that were released in the meantime. Learning `react` was on top of my list. I am glad that I got the opportunity to learn React from Akshay Saini himself in the live course, who is the founder of Namaste Javascript youtube channel, which delivers clear explanation for all core js concepts. 


I am currently looking for job opportunities in Netherlands and Remote. If you have any leads, please let me know in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshitha-sv/).
