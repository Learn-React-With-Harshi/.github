## Welcome to my learning space ðŸ‘‹

I will be documenting my react learning journey in this series. I am learning React through [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by [Akshay Saini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaymarch7/) and enjoying every session. 

### Where to start ?

### About me :pray: :

I'm Harshitha and I worked as a software engineer :woman_technologist: in Bangalore (India) for 3+ years before moving to Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

I took a conscious decision of taking a break from my career to spend time and energy on myself and my family. Currently, I am full-time parent :breast_feeding: (on a career break for 3 years now), taking care of my toddler :family_man_woman_girl: and rebooting myself to bounce back to work. 

It's never too late to restart our careers. I am ready to start it all again with a strong foundation. In my career reboot 2.0 journey, I am revisiting all the front-end core skills like javascript, CSS, HTML, and other libraries. There are a lot of new features to catch up on that were released in the meantime. Learning `React` in-depth was on top of my list. I am glad that I got the opportunity to learn React from Akshay Saini himself in the live course, who is the founder of Namaste Javascript youtube channel, which delivers clear explanations for all core-js concepts.

I am currently looking for job opportunities in Netherlands and Remote. If you have any leads that match my skills, please let me know on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshitha-sv/).
