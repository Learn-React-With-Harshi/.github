## Welcome to my learning space 👋

I will be documenting my react learning journey in this series. I am learning React through [Namaste React Live Course](https://learn.namastedev.com/) conducted by Akshay Saini

### About me :pray: :

I'm Harshitha and I worked as a front-end developer woman_technologist: in Bangalore (India) for 3 years before moving to Amsterdam (Netherlands). 

Currently, I am stay-at-home-mom :breast_feeding: (on a career break for 3 years now), taking care of my toddler :family_man_woman_girl: and slowly rebooting myself to bounce back to work.

I am revising all the frond-end core skills like javascript, css and html and other libraries. There are lot of new features to catch up that were released in the meantime. Learning react was on top of my list. I am glad that I have the opportunity to learn React from Akshay Saini himself, who is the founder of Namaste Javascript youtube channel, which delivers clear explanation for all core js concepts.
